# Pokemon Zring

## Introduction
It's no secreat that my Son is my biggest Muse.  After watching the second season of Pokemon Son and Moon, he made a request for me to make him his own Z RING.  A Braclet worn by pokemon trainers to unlock special powers in their pokemon.  Of course, i could have bought him one, but what fun would that be :P?  The template of the following ZRing design is based on the following toy design:
<div align="center"><img src="image/zring toy.png" width = "450" alt="solidworks image capture" align=center /> </div>

## Final Result
<div align="center"><img src="image/zring.png" width = "450" alt="solidworks image capture" align=center /> </div>
